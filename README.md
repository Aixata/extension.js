# create-browser-extension

> Cross-browser web extension development made easy

`create-browser-extension` is the tool we all wanted for years: an integrated, fast, intuitive tool to build cross-browser extensions. Develop extensions with built-in support for esnext, module imports/exports, hot-reload, unit testing, and more.
